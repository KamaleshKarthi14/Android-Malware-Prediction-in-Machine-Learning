# Android-Malware-Prediction-in-Machine-Learning
In this Project we are going to see how to implement a machine learning supervised learning classification type
using android malware prediction data-set. 
The data set contain detail's about application working with combination of malware app and good app.
Using that we are going to build a model using decision tree 
but here problem is my data-set in the form of imbalanced data-set 
so I converted my data-set into balance data set and trained a model
